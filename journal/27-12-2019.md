- Everything after this commit:
  > 9b4955f trying an alternate loglike computation
  aims at testing whether I should include the `p(y_inj | theta)` term in the
  likelihood always (for log-likelihood, DIC, and LPML). This is what I do
  in the paper.

- This commit:
  > `9ee1d22 corrected docstring log(cpo)`
  is the last commit before the previous commit. If things go really bad,
  revert to this version. This version does not include the `p(y_inj |theta)`
  term for missing `y_inj`, because it was not "data". But this rationale
  doesn't seem to hold up. `p(y_in, m_in) = prod_j p(y_{inj} | theta) x p_inj
  ^m_inj x (1 - p_inj) ^ m_inj`. The final term is a constant . But I have 
  no right to remove the first term (even when `m_inj == 0`).
