- I noticed that in the simulation studies, `W` was large for the appropriate
  values, but not exactly 0 for the ones that should be zero. In addition, most
  of the `r`s were 1. This seems to be fixed by placing an informative prior on
  omega so that omega is negative a-priori (e.g. omega_p ~ Normal(-10, 1)).
  Now, `r`s are more common in the posterior, and match the simulation truth.
